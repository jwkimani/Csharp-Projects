Lab Six
=======
Write a program in which you would:
    1.  Generate 100 random integer values between 0 and 1000. Display the number of even values generated as well as the smallest, the largest, and the range of values. Output should be displayed in a Windows Messagebox.
    You can look at the Random class in C#.
 
    For example, in your Messagebox, there will be:
 
    Even numbers: 54
    Smallest number: 0
    Largest number:  993
    Range of numbers: 0 - 993
 
    2. Prompt the user for the length of three line segments as integers. If the three lines could form a triangle, print the integers and a
    message indicating that they can form a triangle. Otherwise print the integers and a message indicating that they can not form a triangle. Recall that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side to form a triangle. (What kind of loop should we use?)
 
    For example:
    *** You can be prompted to enter 3 integers which could possibly
    *** be the respective lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
 
    Please enter the first integer: 20
    Please enter the second integer: 1
    Please enter the third integer: 3
 
     * The numbers 20, 1, and 3 CANNOT represent sides of the same triangle. *
 
    Would you like to try 3 numbers?
      Please enter 'y' for yes or another letter for no: y
 
    Please enter the first integer: 10
    Please enter the second integer: 6
    Please enter the third integer: 8
 
     * The numbers 10, 6, and 8 CAN represent sides of the same triangle. *
 
 
    Would you like to try 3 numbers?
      Please enter 'y' for yes or another letter for no: n
